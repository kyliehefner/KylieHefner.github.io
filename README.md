# Kylie Hefner's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This website showcases a selection of 7 projects that I have completed in the last year. The projects use languages and tools including Python, R, SQL, APIs, Tableau, and machine learning.

## Technologies Used
This website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Credits
The design of this website is based on the Massively template from HTML5 UP, which was created by @ajlkn. I have made some modifications to the original design to suit my preferences and needs.
